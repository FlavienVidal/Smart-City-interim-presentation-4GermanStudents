# Smart City

Here is an interim presentation I had to pitch for German Students in 2018

How can cities adopt innovative technologies to collect data and turn it into valuable insights to address urban challenges. How can decision makers tap into this data to visualize, explore, and build sophisticated analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence. 
Real-time insights are helping cities make smarter choices, improve quality of life for their residents, respond more effectively to their needs, and offer better solutions to unforeseen incidents from weather to security threats.
